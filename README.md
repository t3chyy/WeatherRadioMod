# The Weather Radio Mod

![The Weather Radio Mod](wxmod.png)

The Weather Radio Mod adds various different kind of weather and AM/FM radios into Minecraft for your decorating needs!

This mod is currently only available for 1.18.2, However, v1.1 will be available on 1.18.2, 1.19.3 & 1.20 when it comes out

**A new and final update is currently in the works, v1.1 will be the last version of the mod until discontinuation, The reason behind this is that I'm leaving the EAS community and all of it's related topics, including weather radio collecting & anything correlated to that genre. This update will leave the mod in a more finished state than what it is currently.**

**For some reason Curseforge disallows mods with the word "Mod" in the name, and for this reason it is called "T3chyy's Weather Radios".**
